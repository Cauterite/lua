Adds two new library functions `table.freeze(t)` and `table.isfrozen(t)`.
Once a table is frozen, it cannot be mutated in any way, and cannot be un-frozen.
With a frozen table, values cannot be assigned, keys cannot be added or removed, metatables cannot be assigned or removed.
However, the immutability is not transitive; objects contained in the table may still be mutable.
